# GuppShupp – Memory & Personality Engine Assignment

This project is my implementation of the GuppShupp Founding AI Engineer assessment.  
It focuses on two core areas of companion AI:

1. **Memory Extraction**
   - Identifying user preferences  
   - Recognising emotional patterns  
   - Extracting long-term facts worth remembering  

2. **Personality Engine**
   - Transforming a neutral assistant reply into different tones  
     (mentor, witty friend, therapist, etc.)
   - Showing before/after response differences

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit (simple UI layer)  
- OpenAI API  
- Virtual environment (`.venv`)  
- Modular Python files for clarity

## How to Run

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py


## Notes

This project was built for the GuppShupp technical assignment.  
It is intentionally simple, modular, and easy to extend.
